<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am motivated by my love for technology, problem-solving,
  and I am committed to continuous learning to become a
  better and more creative full-stack developer.Having
  recently graduated from the 16-week intensive School of
  Code Bootcamp I went from knowing nothing to being
  taught how to work and collaborate effectively within an
  Agile tech team that operates at a high level of performance,
  resulting in the creation and deployment of software</p>

  <p>I am relearning to freshen up my mind and get stronger in learning 
    my tech stacks </p>
